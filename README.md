# Artificial Intelligence (2021-2022)

This repository contains the **theoretical** and **programming** sets of the **Artificial Intelligence** lecture series held by NTUA during the 7th semester
of the ECE undergraduate course. In short, the sets involve the following AI concepts:

- Solution Search Algorithms
- Propositional & First-Order Logic
- Introduction to Machine Learning and Neural Networks

Specifically the labs involved:

- In Lab1 we implement algorithms for the creation of a labyrinth as well as for finding our way out of it.In this we compare in practice Dijkstra,A*,Best First Search.
- In Lab2 we implement a simple movie recommender with Prolog predicates based on an imdb dataset of movies.
- In Lab3 we implement some Machine Learning Algorithms(Naive Bayes,KNN) and a simple Neural Network for a  music recommender.
